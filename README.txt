# Monkey’s Jungle Quest v5 (Demo PWA)

This is a drag‑and‑drop **PWA** (installable app) demo with 2 working mini‑games (Banana Count & Memory),
and placeholders for Maze, Puzzle, Hide & Seek.

## How to deploy (easiest)
1. Go to **Netlify Drop** (drop.netlify.com).
2. Drag the entire folder you downloaded (or the ZIP) onto the page.
3. Netlify will deploy it and give you a live link like `https://something.netlify.app`.

## Add to Home Screen (iPhone)
- Open the live link in **Safari**, tap **Share**, then **Add to Home Screen**.

## QR code
- After you have the live link, you can generate a QR from any QR site and print it inside your book.


## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Unzip this folder.
2. Upload **all files and folders** (index.html, assets/, games/, ages/, etc.) to your GitHub repo **root**.
3. In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: **Deploy from a branch** → Branch: **main / root** → Save.
4. Open: https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO/

Tip: If your site is served from a subpath, keep links root-relative as in this project.
